## OGL 1.2 Survey Response Guideline

[The text of the OGL 1.2 can be found
here.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/39j2li89/OGL1.2_DraftForDiscussionPurpose.pdf)

[The survey to provide feedback can be found
here.](https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7182208/OGL-1-2-Feedback-Survey)

Please read this entire guideline, before beginning to answer questions.

### Would you like to provide feedback on the content of the proposed OGL 1.2

Answer **yes** to this question.

### Now that you've read the proposed OGL 1.2, what concerns of questions come
to mind for you?

In order of their appearance in the OGL 1.2, consider mentioning the following
talking points in your own language.

*   1ai - Only including the SRD 5.1 and subsequent releases leaves those
    creating content under the OGL 1.0 for 3rd edition, or any other game not
    connected to D&D which used the **open** license, unable to adopt this
    license. This is made more explicit in the paragraph above, which
    explicitly restricts this to a license between you and WOTC.

*   1aiii - The wording of this indicates the license is only a license which
    allows for the usage of D&D licensed property. This is then not an open
    license, in the sense intended by the OGL 1.0, as it contains no provision
    for using open gaming content declared by other users of the OGL (see 1ai).

*   1b - Until as recently as November of 2021, Wizards of the Coast expressly
    stated on their website that the OGL could be used to distribute computer
    software, and even video games. This departure of intent in the usage of
    the OGL would leave any person developing this products unable to continue
    doing so.

*   2 - This section explicitly defines irrevocable as

    > Meaning that content licensed under this license can never be withdrawn
    > from thlis license

    This is different to the more common legal definition

    > Meaning that this license cannot be changed or terminated in any way by
    > anyone.

    This appears to be an attempt at appeasing the community requesting the OGL
    1.0a be treated as irrevocable, as [was intended by its
    authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vz9ogq7JTg). In redefining it in
    a way that is different to this definition, it appears to simply be an
    attempt at appeasement, and provides none of the genuine protections the
    community was asking for.

*   3a - Preventing those winning a lawsuit against WOTC for theft of content
    from seeking injunctive relief effectively gives WOTC permission to steal
    content, regardless of the wording ot the rest of section 3.

*   5b - Permitting authors to license their own content separately alongside
    the OGL does not remedy the fact all existing content published under the
    OGL 1.0a is not expressly able to be used under this license. This content
    was released under the belief that the OGL was an open license which would
    enable content sharing in perpetuity, and so very little of it contains
    separately available licensing for the open gaming content it defined.

*   6f - A morality cause makes the usage of this license unviable and
    non-open. The inclusion of this clause makes the entire license not a true
    "open" license in any way. It is not WOTCs place to act as morality police,
    and it would be difficult for any organization to feel safe releasing
    content which could have its license revoked on any grounds at the sole
    discretion of WOTC. While current WOTC may align perfectly with every
    single persons understanding and intentions of acceptable conduct (already
    an impossible feat), this situation may not persist. The intellectual
    property rights which govern this license may one day fall to [insert the
    culture war faction you most disagree with here]. There is no way to
    predict or guard against this unfortunate future, and it makes the usage of
    the license a complete non starter.

*   9d - This is in effect a termination clause, it is normal for licenses to
    be able to void any part of them that is found to be unenforceable, but
    placing the power to wipe the entire license if only a part of it is found
    unenforceable acts as means for WOTC to revoke the license. Further
    confirming it is not "irrevocable" in the traditional legal understanding
    of the word.

*   9e, 9g - Preventing those using the license from joining a class action
    lawsuit or jury trial against WOTC limits their recourse in the instance
    that WOTC acts in bad faith in its execution of this license. While the
    current owners of WOTC may have no intentions of acting in bad faith, as
    with the morality clause detailed in 6f this fact may not be true in the
    future.

The following is the full text of my response, please do not copy it as this
will devalue both my and your response as it may appear as a form of "spam
campaign" in whichever systems they use to filter responses.

> The OGL 1.2 is worded as an explicit license between the 3rd party creator
> and WOTC. This was not the case for the OGL 1.0\. This means that the license
> does not extend to 3rd party to 3rd party relations, as was the case with OGL
> 1.0 and it's open gaming content provisions. This effectively means that
> there is no mechanism by which Open Gaming Content as defined in the OGL 1.0
> can be used or created through the OGL 1.2\. This means that existing content
> created under OGL 1.0 as Open Gaming Content is not usable, and enters a

> In addition, while the community has been asking for the inclusion of the

> In fact, that typical meaning of the word irrevocable is explicitly discarded

### After reading the proposed OGL 1.2, how has your perception of the future
of Dungeons & Dragons changed compared to before reading OGL 1.2?

Answer this question honestly. They have phrased it as if to imply that your
perception may have improved from the leaks of the 1.1 to the release of the
1.2\. I would instead recommend responding to it as if it was asking how your
perception of the future of Dungeons & Dragons has changed compared to before
the leak of the 1.1.

For me, this perception is **worse**. If you answer "better" or "much better"
you will not see the following question.

### What would be needed to improve your perception of Dungeons & Dragons'
future?

Answer relating to the points you raised in question 1.

My answer was

> Remedies to the issues raised in question 1 would go a long way to improving
> my perceptions on the future of D&D, but the only way I can see a bright and
> prosperous future continuing is if the OGL 1.0a remains an authorized
> license.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your satisfaction with
the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International?

Answer this honestly, but take the time to read through the
[license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) and [human
readable (non legalese) summary
page](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

I answered 5 to both understanding and satisfaction.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the content found in the SRD that will be released under
Creative Commons?

Rate this honestly, but consider that the cc license is a purely textual
license, and the ideas presented by the text are not copyrightable to begin
with.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 2 to my satisfaction.

### Do you have any other comments about the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International and/or the content that will be released under Creative Commons?

Provide an honest answer based on your understanding of the above. Consider
raising the following concerns in your own words.

*   The Creative Commons is a license purely concerned with the text of the
    SRD. In several places WOTC speaks of putting "game mechanics" into the
    creative commons, which is not possible as game mechanics are not something
    which can be copyrighted.
*   The list of things in the SRD placed into the creative commons is small,
    and does not include things such as lists of spells. It is unlikely that
    WOTC would win a claim of ownership over many of these spells in court, as
    it simply an alphabetical enumeration of common words. But releasing this
    into the creative commons would be a welcome sign of acting in good faith
    with the community.

I responded with the following.

> Much of the textual content present in the sections placed under the creative
> commons describe rules which are not something that can be copyrighted to
> begin with, and the textual releases are of limited use.
> 
> More concerning are the parts of the SRD which were not placed into the
> creative commons. Such as spell lists. This implies which that WOTC intends
> to defend its ownership over things such as the common names of spells such
> "fireball". These are widespread and used in many properties, and I would
> much prefer to see WOTC include these in their lists of creative commons
> content to calm fears over a return to the overly litigious days of TSR.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the Notice of Deauthorization?

Rate this honestly, considering the impacts of the deauthorization of the OGL
1.0a listed in the talking points for question 1.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 1 to my satisfaction.

### Do you have any other comments about the Notice of Deauthorization?

Consider raising the following talking points.

*   Ryan Dancy, the VP of WOTC at the time the OGL was created, who spearheaded
    its creation, has confirmed multiple times that if the ability to
    deauthorize the OGL 1.0 was something intended for WOTC to have, that it
    would have been explicitly stated in the license.
*   Azora Law, the intellectual property law firm which wrote the text of the
    original OGL, have confirmed through a third party that the OGL 1.0 was
    never intended to be revocable.
*   Lisa Stevens and Jim Butler, who were leaders on the Dungeons & Dragons
    team at Wizards when the OGL 1.0 was written, do not believe the OGL 1.0
    can be deauthorized.
*   Monte Cook, a senior designer at WOTC at the time the OGL 1.0 was written,
    has stated he observed "how hard those drafting it tried to sincerely make
    it so that it would last forever and would never screw over anyone that
    used it."
*   Wizards of the Coasts own FAQ on the OGL, which was removed from their
    website in November of 2021, stated that "if Wizards made a change you
    disagreed with [to the OGL], you could continue to use an earlier,
    acceptable version".

My response was as follows

> Deauthorizing the OGL is an act of bad faith that ruins any trust I would
> personally be able to have in WOTC going forward. Wizards own FAQ on the OGL,
> which I read when understanding the implications of using the OGL 1.0a in my
> own works, explicitly stated that if "Wizards made a change you disagreed
> with" to the OGL, "you could continue to use an earlier, acceptable version".
> 
> Deauthorizing the OGL essentially makes this advice, which was presented on
> your website for the better part of 20 years, a lie.
> 
> I do not believe it was a lie when it was written as I do not believe that,
> even if you continue using the language surrounding "deauthorizong the OGL",
> it is something you have the power to do.
> 
> Ryan Dancey, who spearheaded its creation, has confirmed this was never an
> intended power for WOTC to have in relation to the OGL. In addition to this
> Azora Law, the law firm that wrote the text of the OGL 1.0, have confirmed
> through the words of Lisa Stevens and Jim Butler (leaders on Dungeons &
> Dragons team at the time the OGL 1.0 was released) that this was never an
> intended power.
> 
> If you continue with this language, I fully expect it to be defeated in court
> as some third party publisher will attempt to release content still licensed
> under 1.0a, as provisioned for in the original OGL 1.0 in clauses 4 and 9,
> and they will win. Continuing to include this language seems to me to be
> acting in bad faith, and attempting to scare the D&D community away from
> considering this inevitability.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the types of content covered by the proposed OGL 1.2?

Rate this honestly, considering the significant change this makes to the types
of content which can be placed under the OGL 1.2 compared with the OGL 1.0, as
discussed in the talking points of question 1.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 2 to my satisfaction.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the content ownership rights outlined in the proposed OGL
1.2?

Rate this honestly, considering the limitations and restrictions placed on
those who use the OGL 1.2 to legally defend themselves from content theft or
any potential bad faith dealing by WOTC as outlined in the talking points of
question 1.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 2 to my satisfaction.

### Do you have any other comments about the types of content covered and/or
the content ownership rights outlined by the proposed OGL 1.2?

Consider reitterating the points raised in 1b, 3a, 9e and 9g in the talking
points for question 1.

I answered the following:

> In the FAQ for the OGL 1.0, it explicitly stated that video game content and
> software programs were an acceptable usage of the license. Removing this
> power from the license significantly harms anyone developing a game based
> upon the OGL 1.0\. This has been done historically successfully a number of
> times.
> 
> In addition to this, while the license states repeatedly that "you own your
> content", being unable to seek injunctive relief, even in the event that a
> court agrees it is the case the WOTC stole content from a third party author,
> means that in effect a license back provision is present, but not explicitly
> spelled out. This lowers my trust that WOTC is acting in good faith with
> clauses 3a, 9e, and 9g significantly.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the "You Control Your Content" section?

Rate this honestly, considering the limitations placed on existing OGL 1.0a
content which will have not been separately licensed prior as is permitted by
5b, as no such requirement existed for Open Gaming Content under the OGL 1.0.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 3 to my satisfaction.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the "Warranties And Disclaimers" section?

Rate this honestly, considering the implications of the morality clause present
in 6f, and the impacts this may have going forward.

I answered 5 to my understanding, an 1 to my satisfaction.

### How would you rate your level of understanding and your level of
satisfaction with the "Modification Or Termination" section?

Rate this honestly, considering the impacts of 7bi when combined with 6f.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 2 to my satisfaction.

### Do you have any other comments about the "You Control Your Content",
"Warranties And Disclaimers", or "Modification Or Termination" sections?

Consider reiterating the points raised about 6f in the talking points for
question 1.

I answered the following:

> For the avoidance of doubt, I shall restate part of my answer to question 1.
> 
> Clause 6f is of particular concern to me. It essentially gives WOTC the power
> to, in its sole discretion, revoke this license from anyone. While it may
> seem that WOTC could be trusted to only use this power to revoke the license
> from those peddling racism and hatred, the inclusion of the word "obscene" is
> of particular concern to me. There are many places in the world where
> "obscene" is used to marginalize minorities. The existence of gay people was
> argued as inherently sexual and banned from being taught to children in my
> party of my own country until 2010 (kent, in the UK). This same kind of issue
> is seen in the backsliding of LGBT rights in the US, and transgender rights

> people as inherently obscene, I can feel no confidence that if this
> backsliding continues future owners of the license (be it future directors at

> 
> As a transgender, bisexual, polyamorous woman. I hope you can understand the

> determined to be "obscene" by a future rights holder of the D&D IP.

### How would you rate your understanding and your level of satisfaction with
the Virtual Tabletop Policy? // Do you have any other comments about the
Virtual Tabletop Policy?

Guidelines for issues with the policy, and answering these two questions, have
been provided by Foundry VTT in a far better form than I would hope to present
them here, without simply copying what was said in [their post on the
matter](https://foundryvtt.com/article/ogl12-response-feedback/). I strongly
recommend you read that post.

I answered 5 to my understanding, and 1 to my satisfaction. For aditional
comments, I wrote the following:

> I do not believe attempting to limit the creativity and freedoms of VTTs to
> innovate in the space is a constructive one. The example given of animations
> give poor clarity and little clear indication of what is intended. In
> addition to this, the license itself acknowledges the need to adapt and
> change with technology through the provisions in 7a to modify sections 5 and
> 9a. But does not provide the same affordances to innovation and technological
> change to virtual tabletops.

### Have you used the OGL 1.0a or previous version of the OGL to create third
party content?

Answer this honestly. I answered
[yes](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/371591/Fresh-From-The-Forge).

### Do you want to create third party content for Dungeons & Dragons in the
future?

Answer this honestly. I answered no.

### Would you be comfortable releasing TTRPG content under the OGL 1.2 as
written?

Answer this honestly. I answered no.

### Why do you say that?

Relate your answer to previously discussed talking points. I answered the
following:

> As a minority, and one who is constantly subjected to attacks of my existence
> being "obscene", and a danger to children to learn about or be around, and
> observing an aggressive reduction in the rights and freedoms of others like
> me being pushed through courts and state legislatures in the US and UK, I
> would not feel comfortable releasing any material under a license which
> could, at the sole discretion of WOTC, determine my existence and thus my
> content to be obscene and to see that licensed revoked. I could not stake my
> livelihood against this not happening.
> 
> That aside, I do not desire to use the OGL 1.2 to release content for
> Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition or for One D&D. But instead to use it on the
> large body of work created over the last 20 years which used the OGL 1.0
> under the good faith assumption that WOTC was not lying on their FAQ, and
> that it would be a true open license upon which games entirely unrelated to
> D&D could be built. A fantastic example of this is a game like Fate Core.
> This is not possible under the terms of the OGL 1.2, and thus would not be
> suitable for my usage.

### Compared to the OGL 1.0a, do you feel that you would be able to continue
developing content the same way under the proposed OGL 1.2? // Why do you say
that?

Answer honestly, I have answered no, with the following explanation:

> The content I am creating is expressly not able to be created under the OGL
> 1.2\. It uses open gaming content declared in a previously released OGL 1.0a
> product, and as the OGL 1.2 is explicitly a license between WOTC and myself,
> it contains no provisions for me to use this OGL 1.0a open gaming content.
> 
> For this reason primarily, it would be impossible for me to develop content
> under the OGL 1.2 in the same way as under the OGL 1.0a. My only option would
> be to release under the OGL 1.0a, and fight against the legitimacy of the
> deauthorization of the OGL 1.0a in court.

### How would you rate your interest in using the Content Creator Badge as part
of your third party works? // Do you have any other comments about Content
Creator Badget?

Answer this question honestly. I have answered 1, and provided no further
comments.

### What other feedback do you have for us (related to the Open Games License
or otherwise)?

Answer with any feedback you do not feel was adequately explained in your
previous answers. I responded with the following:

> I am glad to see WOTC acting in better faith with the OGL 1.2 than with the
> OGL 1.1, though it would improve my confidence greatly if you would stop
> referring to the OGL 1.1 as an "early draft" in future publications. While
> technically as the license was not released to the public, it was a "draft",
> many third party publishers have confirmed it was presented to them as
> essentially final. They felt pressured into signing alternative agreements
> with WOTC to avoid the harmful terms of the leaked OGL 1.1\. I also wish you
> would stop pretending that the company had any intention to gather community
> feedback on the OGL 1.1\. The only reason we had the opportunity to respond
> was because of the significant uproar raised by the community over the leaks.
> 
> The only way I can see a new license being acceptable, is if it is a true
> open gaming license, and removes the terms which allow WOTC at its sole
> discretion to cancel peoples usage of the license arbitrarily. In addition to
> this the license must contain provisions for using open gaming content from

> new content to the corpus of open gaming content, in order for it to be a
> legitimate open license.
> 
> In all reality, in an ideal world, I would like to see these plans put to
> rest.
> 
> By all means create a new license for those who wish to create content for
> OneD&D, but do not attempt to claim you can "deauthorize" the OGL 1.0, and
> allow its continued existence providing third party content and support for
> third edition, fifth edition, and all the other wonderful games that were
> built assuming that the OGL 1.0 was an honest and true perpetual,
> irrevocable, open license.
