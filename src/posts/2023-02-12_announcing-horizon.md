# Announcing Horizon

Horizon is an upcoming digital toolkit designed for use with Old-School
Essentials. Its goal is to enhance your play at the table and online by
providing digital tools that improve the play experience. It will provide
character sheets with automated inventory management for players and campaign
and session management tools for the referee. It will also include automatic
initiative and combat phase tracking, as well as tools to assist with all other
common procedures in the game.

The project will launch with support for the Old-School Essentials Classic
Fantasy variant, built using its free SRD under the Open Gaming License. After
that, we'll reach out to first and third-party publishers in the Old-School
Essentials space to integrate more aspects of the game and provide a new
digital storefront for them to sell through.

You won't have to buy PDFs of games you already own. The versions available on
Horizon feature a completely separate and new digitization. This includes
automation of new classes and equipment, as well as tools that will help you
run specific adventures. The experience provided through Horizon will be
superior to what would be possible with a PDF or physical copy of any game
materials purchased.

Purchasing published content won't be the only way to access new classes,
equipment, and monsters. Although it may not be available at launch, Horizon
will feature a comprehensive homebrew creative suite, allowing you to bring the
content you've created onto the platform without having to directly partner
with us to make it available for general sale.

While we're eager to show off the parts of this tool that already work, a
preview won't be available until later, when we begin preparing for our
official launch, which is planned for later this year.

Once it's launched, there will be a two-tier pricing structure available. The
free tier is a feature-complete version of Horizon, but it will restrict you to
only being able to host one game and participate in three games. We believe
this should be enough for most average users. You'll also be restricted to 10
MB of file uploads, so make sure to compress your maps and images!

Horizon Plus, which will cost $8, will grant you unlimited games joined and
hosted, and will enable multi-referee tools in games that you host, for all
your large-scale West Marches and open table needs! The storage limit will be
lifted, but if you start overwhelming our servers with too many files, we may
send you an email asking you to cut back a little. We hope to eventually
sweeten the deal on Horizon Plus by adding free content drops and other Plus
member benefits.

This announcement will also serve as the official start of the Horizon
ecosystem. Those of you with a keen eye who have been following Lucille L.
Blumire on the internet for a while will likely have known about this ahead of
time, and this blog already has some of the best articles she's written, tidied
up, and ported over.

In addition, [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Horizon-RPG) will
provide the media arm of Horizon, which will eventually be full of video
reviews, creator interviews, and content focused on discussions. [The community
discord](https://discord.com/invite/gBUZN42kaX) can serve as a hub for
discussing the Horizon project with others who have an interest in it, and it's
available to join today!

The team making all of this happen currently consists of [Lucille L.
Blumire](https://llblumire.co.uk) as a Lead Developer, with some of her friends
and family, providing additional content and support.

We'll be collecting FAQ questions from the Discord, and adding them to the
bottom of this article, so come and say hello and ask all of your excellent
questions about the project!
