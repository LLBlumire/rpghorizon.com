## Dungeon 23 - Week 1

Dungeon23 is a year long megadungeon creation challenge, created on twitter,
and formatted as follows.

 - Every day of 2023, create 1 room of the megadungeon
 - Every week of rooms is one area of a floor of the dungeon
 - Every month of rooms is one floor of the dungeon

By the end of this process, one would have a megadungeon with 365 rooms across
12 floors.

For my Dungeon23, I am going to be creating a
[tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) dungeon. Instead of 12
floors, there will be 24 faces. The faces will connect to each other in a way
that is topologically consistent with a tesseract. Each face connects to the
eight other faces it shares an edge with through a door or other transition
mechanism. The 4D faces are harder to access, and will require 6 keys from the
first 3D cube cell of faces in order to enter. Likewise the 3D cube cell
offset in the fourth dimension from the first cell will only be accessible
after acquiring 12 keys from the faces of the 6 3D cube cells which share a
face with the first cell that are not part of the final cell. The final 6 faces
will unlock "the heart of the tesseract".
