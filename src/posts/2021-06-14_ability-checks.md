    Ability Checks have become the core of D&D in its later editions, and while
    the older editions have a system for making them, it is often best not to!

## Alternatives To Ability Checks

In the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, ability checks are the main system
used to resolve actions and determine success or failure. In older roleplaying
adventure games, there are alternative methods for resolving actions that do
not involve using ability checks.

Basic D&D has a system for ability checks, as in later editions. It does not
feature the skill systems of later editions, and so is much simpler.

>
> **Rolling an ability check:** The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is
> less than or equal to the ability, the check succeeds. If the roll is greater
> than the ability, the check fails.
>
> **Modifiers:** Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be applied, depending on
> the difficulty of the task. A modifier of –4 would be a relatively easy
> ability check, and a +4 would be very difficult.

This ability check system in has a disadvantage compared to newer editions. In
this editions, characters do not increase their ability scores as they progress
in the game and their initial ability scores are usually average. As a result,
most ability checks only have a 50% chance of success, which can be frustrating
for players.

Players who are used to the newer editions of Dungeons & Dragons may try to use
the ability check system in basic edition in a similar way, but may not have a
good experience due to the differences in the system. However, there are
alternative methods that can be used for various situations instead of using
the ability check system.

### Athletics

Consider the potential consequences of an action before deciding whether to use
an ability check or an alternative method. For example, if the action carries
the risk of instant death, a "save versus death" check may be appropriate. If
the penalty for failure is delay or inconvenience, a "save versus paralysis"
check may be a better choice. If there is no penalty for failure, the action
can simply happen without the need for a check. For lifting heavy objects, it
may be helpful to set a required strength rating and determine if the character
or group has the necessary strength to lift it when adding together their
ability scores.

### Acrobatics

In later editions the Acrobatics skill is used to perform nimble actions such
as running across slippery surfaces, balancing on tightropes, and maintaining
one's footing in general. For most situations where Acrobatics would be used,
it is recommended to allow the character to succeed or impose a penalty, such
as a -2 to attack rolls, instead of requiring a check. If the action carries
the risk of death or paralysis, a "death save" or "paralysis save" may be
appropriate as with Athletics. Alternatively, instead of using a save, it may
be more effective to alter the environment or how the character interacts with
it.

### Slight of Hand

A Thief will succeed at this automatically. No other class of adventurer should
be attempting it. If it's being used to pick pockets, consult the thiefs
percentille chance to succeed at this task.

### Stealth

Stealth already exists within the game, and is handled by the rules for
surprise. You can learn about this in the [common
skills](/posts/2020-07-11_skill-system/) and [thief
skills](/posts/2020-09-27_thief-class/) articles.

### Arcana, History, Nature, Religion

Consider freely giving success to characters based on their class and level, as
not knowing something can be less enjoyable for the player and less interesting
for the story. For example, a Magic-User character should know a fact about
arcana or may need to be a higher level to know it, a Thief character should
know a fact about history, a Halfling or Elf character should know a fact about
nature, and a Cleric character should know a fact about religion.

### Investigation

Rules for investigation are covered by the Search skill, which allows
characters to have a 1-in-6 chance of finding hidden objects in a 10-foot by
10-foot area. However, if a player character specifically describes searching
in a location where something is hidden, the hidden object should be revealed.
The Search skill is intended as a fallback for when characters spend time
checking every possible location. If a character is described as carefully
pushing each brick in a wall and a hidden door is opened by pressing a specific
tile, the Search skill should automatically succeed without the need for a
check or additional time expenditure.

### Animal Handling

Make a reaction roll for the animal. Give a +1 bonus to the reaction roll if
the character is an appropriate class such as Ranger.

### Insight

In most cases, a character's disposition towards the party can be determined
based on their reaction to the party. If the party is suspicious of someone,
the players can ask about their body language and listen for any indications of
nervousness or evasion, rather than requiring an Insight check to gather this
information. As with knowledge checks, noticing important details is usually
more engaging and interesting for the player than not noticing them.

### Medicine

Treat this the same as the other knowledge skills.

### Perception

Use a similar approach as for investigation, in addition to that, surprise
forms the basis for perception and stealth, and so these both complement each
other in using surprise instead of either skill.

### Survival

Characters in an adventure should generally be competent and have the basic
wilderness skills necessary for survival. For more specialized skills such as
predicting the weather or tapping a tree for sap, consider the character's
class and whether it is reasonable for them to have that skill based on what
has been established about their background and experiences. For example, a
Woodsman character should have a good understanding of the weather and a
character from the far north should be able to recognize a crevasse.

### Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Performance

Charisma checks can be replaced by using reaction rolls to determine the
response of the character being influenced. In some cases, such as when the
party is trying to intimidate someone, a morale check may be more appropriate.
