    discussion of Basic D&D. This article aims to demistify them and
    explain how one can interpret them based on the original wording

Spell and Spell-Like Effect Interpretations for Read Magic, Continual Light,
and Turn Undead
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article is an intentionally published draft, pending improvements.

There are a few spells and mechanics in Basic D&D which present rules and
descriptions that do not match up with how people commonly interpret them.

By looking at old play-examples, and the original wording of these rules, we
can get a better understanding of what may have been the authors intent, and
can attempt to build an interpretation which is practical and useful to use at
gaming tables today.

### Read Magic

The topic of discussion that always follows Read Magic is it's status as touch
spell and its duration of 1 turn. One might intuitively expect that read magic
would be cast on a piece of magical text, and it allows the caster to read that
magical text. This isn't an interpretation backed up by the wording of the
rules.

> **Read Magic**
>
> Range: 0
>
> Duration: 1 turn
>
> By casting this spell, magical words or runes on an item or scroll may be
> read. Without this spell unfamiliar magic cannot be read or understood, even
> by a magic-user. However, once a scroll or runes are looked at with a read
> magic spell, the magic-user becomes able to understand and read that item
> later without the spell. A magic-user's or elf's spell book is written so
> that only the owner may read them without using this spell.
>
> &mdash; Basic Dungeons & Dragons (1981)

The range on this spell is listed as "0", which is distinct from "0 (caster
only)", and would imply the spell is a touch spell like Cure Light Wounds and
Remove Fear. However, both of these spells explicitly call out that a touch is
required in their spell descriptions, which is not stated in Read Magic.

This leads to a strange interpretation that the spell is cast by touching an
item or scroll, and allows the caster to read them. One might argue that the spell
could be cast on others through touch, allowing them to read magic, but it
specifies "the magic-user becomes able to understand".

This means that Read Magic is cast on an object, it allows the caster to read any
magical writing on that object for the next 10 minutes. Once they have read the
magical writing they are able to re-read it without the spell being active.

This interpretation was clarified in BECMI.

> **Read Magic**
>
> Range: 0
>
> Duration: 1 turn
>
> Effect: The magic-user only
>
> This spell will allow the magic-user to read, not speak, any magical words or
> runes, such as those found on magic scrolls and other items. Unfamiliar magic
> writings cannot be understood without using this spell. However, once a
> magic-user reads a scroll or runes with this spell, that magic can be read or
> spoken later (without) using a spell. All spell books are written in magic
> words, and only their owners may read them without using this spell.
>
> &mdash; Basic Dungeons & Dragons (1983)

The spell here is clarified to be a spell which is range 0 and only effects the
spellcaster, which in 1981's Basic D&D would have been called "0 (caster
only)", and is consistent with abilities like shield and protection from evil.

This change shifts how the magic is used. Now, read magic is cast on the
spellcaster themselves, and allows them to read any magical writing for the
next 10 minutes. Once they have read the magical writing they are still able to
re-read it without the spell being active. This is a significantly more
powerful version than the one presented in 1981, as it allows the magic-user to
potentially read multiple magical texts in quick succession. 

> **Read Magic**
>
> **Duration:** 1 turn
>
> **Range:** The caster
>
> By means of *read magic*, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions or
> runes, as follows:
>
> - **Scrolls:** The magical script of a scroll of arcane spells can be
>   understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in
>   the future.
> - **Spell books:** A spell book written by another arcane spell caster can be
>   deciphered.
> - **Inscriptions:** Runes or magical words inscribed on an object or surface
>   can be understood.
> - **Reading again:** Once the caster has read a magical inscription using
>   read magic, they are thereafter able to read that particular writing
>   without recourse to the use of this spell.
>
> &mdash; Old-School Essentials (2019)

This presentation of the rules lines up more closely with the 1983 version, not
the 1981 version that Old-School Essentials is based on. If we look in the
Author's Notes on the rules we find no clarification on this rules
interpretation being changed.

It thus seems that this interpretation change was unintentional by Necrotic
Gnome, and may have been caused by a simple misreading of the original rules.
Or a difference in interpretation of "0" without "(caster only)" specified.

This does change the power level of the spell substantially though. If you wish to
go with the more traditional version of the spell, consider using the following
form instead.

> **Read Magic**
>
> **Duration:** 1 turn
>
> **Range:** The caster or a creature touched
>
> By touching a scroll of arcane spells, another magic-users spell book, or a
> surface with magical inscriptions, the caster can decipher it as follows:
>
> - **Scroll** The magical script of the scroll of arcane spells can be
>   understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in
>   the future.
> - **Spell book:** The spell book written by another arcane spell caster can
>   be deciphered.
> - **Inscription:** Runes or magical words inscribed on the object or surface
>   can be understood.
> - **Reading again:** Once the caster has read the magical inscription using

### Continual Light

Confusion about continual light often comes from how it differs from the light
spell, and the nature of the light being cast. To get a full understanding,
we must contrast both light and continual light in Basic Dungeons & Dragons.

> **Light**
>
> Range: 120'
>
> Duration: 6 turns + the level of the caster, in turns
>
> The spell casts light in a circle, 30' in diameter. It is bright enough to
> read by, but not equal to full daylight. It may be cast on an object. The
> **light** may be cast at a creature's eyes. The creature may make a saving
> throw vs. Spells, but if it fails, the victim will be blinded for the
> duration of the spell. In D&D BASIC rules, a blinded creature may not attack.
> The effects of the spell will last for 7 turns if a first level magicuser
> casts the spell, 8 turns for a second level magic-user, and so forth.
>
> &mdash; Basic D&D (1981)

> **Continual Light**
>
> Range: 120'
>
> Duration: permanent
>
> The spell creates a globe of light 60' in diameter (not equal to full
> daylight) which will continue to shed light forever (or until it is
> dispelled). When cast a creature's eyes, blindness may result (see
> **light**).
>
> &mdash; Basic D&D (1981)

The core difference of wording between these two spells arise in the
distinction between "casts light in a circle, 30' in diameter" and "a globe of
light 60' in diameter which will continue to shed light". The first speaks of
light being cast as if from a source, and is the same wording used in Expert
D&D (1981) to talk about the light of a torch.

> **Torch** A torch casts light in a 30' radius for one hour (six game turns).
>
> &mdash; Expert D&D (1981)

Continual light is not casting rays of light, but instead creating a globe of
illumination. It notes that it is not equal to full daylight, so it is clearly
not an impenetrable globe of blinding white light. This leads to the natural
interpretation that the spell indicates a region 60' in diameter centered on
the location or object the spell was cast on is simply illuminated. This
sourceless illumination could not be blocked, and so will pass through
obstructions such as walls and doors. In addition, anything within the orb
would have no shadow as it is being lit from all directions evenly.

This interpretation bucks scientific understanding of light, but from a
perspective of interpreting magic seems quite sensible. It explains the
distinction between 'casting light' and 'a globe of light', and it also
provides a built in balancing mechanism to the permenance of the continual
light spell. Because it cannot be obstructed, one using an object lit by
continual light is essentially unable to effectively hide in dark locations,
where someone using a more temporary light spell or torch could either
extinguish it or cover the light source.

> **Light**
>
> **Duration:** 6 turns + 1 per level
>
> **Range:** 120
>
> This spell has three usages: 
>
> 1. **Conjuring light:** In a 15’ radius. The magical light is sufficient for
>    reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
>    object, in which case the light moves with the object.
> 2. **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target
>    fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A
>    blind creature cannot attack.
> 3. **Cancelling darkness:** *Light* may cancel a *darkness* spell (see
>    below).
>
> &mdash; Old-School Essentials (2019)

> **Continual Light**
>
> **Duration:** Permenant
>
> **Range:** 120'
>
> This spell has three usages:
>
> 1. **Conjuring light:** In a 30’ radius. The magical light is sufficient for
>    reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
>    object, in which case the light moves with the object.
> 2. **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target
>    fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded. A blind creature
>    cannot attack.
> 3. **Cancelling darkness:** *Continual light* may cancel a *continual
>    darkness* spell (see below).
>
> &mdash; Old-School Essentials (2019)

Here, old-school essentials simply speaks of the spells 'conjuring light', and
does not speak to the nature of the light being cast as if by a source, or
simply eminating through the [Lumineferous
aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether). I would propose the
following rewrites to each spell for clarity.

> **Light**
>
> **Duration:** 6 turns + 1 per level
>
> **Range:** 120
>
> This spell has three usages: 
>
> 1. **Casting light:** In a 15’ radius. The magical light is sufficient for
>    reading, but is not as bright as daylight. The spell may be cast upon an
>    object, in which case the light moves with the object. The light
>    originates from the object or location, and may be obstructed.
> 2. **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target
>    fails a **saving throw versus spells**, it is blinded for the duration. A
>    blind creature cannot attack.
> 3. **Cancelling darkness:** *Light* may cancel a *darkness* spell (see

## Turn Undead

Turn Undead is one of the most consistently debated abilities in D&D, perhaps
second only to the proper application of [thief
skills](/posts/2020-09-27_thief-class/). It is also one of the most tampered
with and changed abilities across all editions of dungeons and dragons, with
every single edition altering it slightly from previous ones.

Because of this, we will not look at every version of this ability in this
article, simply the 1981 rules and Old-School Essentials. To quickly summarise
the differences between each edition:

 - D&D 1974 presented a table called "Clerics vs Undead" for turning undead
   with no guidelines on how to use it. The table is consistent with tables
   that will follow in many other editions, having you roll 2d6 equal or over
   a value in order to turn the undead.
 - D&D 1977 Holmes has a similar "Clerics vs Undead" table and the effect
   happen automatically when a cleric confronts undead.
 - AD&D 1977 the table uses a d20 based approach and calls it "Turning Undead",
   and the ability is used like a spell. It is usable once per combat by each
   cleric against each group of like-kinded undead, but if the turning fails it
   may not be recast in that combat again.
 - D&D 1981 has the same approach as in D&D 1977, but now calls the ability
   "Turn Undead". The effect happens when undead monsters are "encountered".
   The table is still called "Clerics vs. Undead" however. Success causes the
   monster to turn and flee from the area. The expert set clarifies that this
   effect works from lowest hit dice to highest.
 - D&D 1983 and 1991 work similarly to in 1981, but instead of it happening
   when encountering undead, it happens in place of an attack. The rules note
   specifically that a cleric cannot attack and turn in one round. The expert
   rules note that these attempts can be repeated as long as the previous one
   succeeded and there are still undead present. The rules do not note how to
   handle mixed groups.
 - AD&D 2e 1995 the table is d20 based and calls it "Turning Undead", and has
   one attempt per cleric per encounter, and the turn counts as an action
   requiring one round and occuring during the characters initative (so can
   happen after undead actions). Unlike in AD&D 1978 mixed groups do not enable
   repeated turnings, but instead the single turning applies from lowest hit
   dice to highest. Turned undead flee until out of sight, or circle at a
   distance no closer than 10 feet.
 - D&D 3e 2000 calls the ability "Turn Undead", clerics may do this three plus
   their charisma modifier times per day. It is treated as an attack, and
   effects undead from closest to furthest away. Instead of rolling on a
   grid-aligned table, clerics can turn within plus or minus four hit dice of
   themselves based on the number they rolled in the turning check. If they
   have twice as many levels they destroy instead of turning. Turned undead
   flee or cower for 1 minute.
 - D&D 3.5e 2003 works the same as in third edition, but gets a +2 bonus to
   their turning check if they have 5 or more ranks in the religion skill.
 - D&D 4e 2008 introduces the "channel divinity" ability, of which "turn
   undead" is a variant of. It is a standard action and first in a close burst
   2 (5 at 11th level, 8 at 21st level). This means it works as an AOE effect
   around the caster. Instead of causing undead to flee as in older editions,
   it knocks them away from the cleric and immobilises them for a turn.
 - D&D Essentials 2010 did not have a turn undead ability. It had a "smite
   undead" channel divinity power which was a melee weapon attack with bonus
   damage and immobilising as in 4e.
 - D&D 5e 2015 brings turn undead back, still as a channel divinity which is
   now once per short rest instead of per encounter. It forces all undead
   within 30 feet to save or flee beyond 30 feet away from you for 1 minute.

As you can see, there are a huge range of mechanics at play when it comes to
turning the undead. For our specific example of building a system for OSE, it
is most beneficial to look at the 1981 basic and expert editions. They are
listed in the above summaries, but the full text of their rules follows.

> When a cleric encounters an **undead** monster, the cleric may attempt to
> "Turn" (scare) the monster in stead of fighting it. If a cleric **Turns** an
> **undead** monster, the monster will not touch the cleric and will flee from
> the area if it can.
>
> When a cleric attempts to **Turn** one or more of the undead, consult the
> **Clerics vs. Undead** table (page B8). Cross-index the cleric's level with the type of
> undead encountered. The result will be **"no effect"**, a **number**, or a **T**.
>
> - **No effect"** means that the cleric cannot **Turn** that type of undead
>   monster (the cleric has not yet gained enough experience to do so).
> - A **number** means that the cleric has a chance at **Turning** some or all
>   of the undead monsters. If the player rolls the given number (or greater)
>   on 2d6, then some of the undead monsters are **Turned**. If the cleric
>   rolls less than the given number, the attempt to **Turn** the undead
>   monsters fails (as in "no effect").
> - A **"T"** means that hte cleric automatically **Turns** some or all of the
>   undead monsters.
>
> If a cleric is successful at **Turning** some undead monsters, the player
> must roll 2d6 to find how many **hit dice** of undead monsters are
> **Turned**. A successful attempt at **Turning** undead will always affect at
> least one undead monster, no matter how few hit dice are affected.

The expert set builds off the above rules with the following.

> When a cleric attempts to **Turn** one or more of the undead, consult the
> **Clerics vs. Undead** table (page X5). Cross-index the cleric's level with
> the type of the **undead** encountered. The result will be a dash

>   rolls less than the given number, the attempt fails.
> - A "**T**" means that the cleric automatically **Turns** some or all of the
>   **undead** monsters.
> - A "**D**" means that the cleric automatically **Dispels** (destroys or
>   disintegrates) some or all of the **undead** monsters.
>
> A cleric may **Turn** or **Dispel** 2&ndash;12 (2d6) hit dice of **undead**.
> If the hit dice total of the undead is greater than the number rolled by the

Both sets have play examples, which speak of characters using the ability the
moment they encounter undead. This is also consistently worded with the encounter
procedures, where the rules determine that characters may take actions when
encountering monsters (as a separate system to combat).

In Old-School essentials, these rules were presented as follows:

> **Turning the Undead**
>
> Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters
> encountered. To turn the undead, the player rolls 2d6. The referee then
> consults the table below, comparing the roll against the HD of the type of
> undead monsters targeted. 
>
> **Successful Turning**
> 
> If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 to determine the
> number of HD affected (turned or destroyed). 
>
> **Turned undead:** Will leave the area, if possible, and will not harm or
> make contact with the cleric. 
>
> **Destroyed undead (result of D):** Are instantly and permanently
> annihilated. 
>
> **Excess:** Rolled Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a monster are
> wasted. 
>
> **Minimum effect:** At least one undead monster will always be affected on a
> successful turning. 
>
> **Mixed groups:** If turn undead is used against a mixed group of undead
> monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.

The above rules are clear on the topics they touch on, but leave many questions
unanswered. Common questions after reading the above rules are:

 - How often can I use turn undead?
 - Where in combat does turn undead occur, it is a spell?
 - How long does 'turn undead' last for?

And these are all reasonable questions. The following is a rewritten version of
turn undead, designed around compatability with the rules of and examples of
play given in the 1981 basic and expert sets, and which answers these
questions.

> **Turning the Undead**
>
> When encountering undead monsters, instead of taking the common actions of
> combat, evasion, or parley (see
> [_**Encounters**_](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Encounters)
> in *Old-School Essentials*), a Cleric can instead invoke the power of their

This limits the power of the ability substantially compared with other
editions, allowing it to be effectively used once per encounter with undead,
only at the start of the encounter, only if the players win initative or if for
some reason the undead monsters do not take the combat action.

This power limiting is not without good reason though, turning undead is
still extremely powerful and can negate encounters with monsters that otherwise
often cannot fail morale (as they will have a morale rating of 12).

### Legal

If you would like to use the amended descriptions I put in this article, they
are open game content, per the OGL underneath. The sections I took from
Old-School Essentials are also obviously Open Game Content. The sections I took
from the older D&D rules are not open game content, but are used under fair
dealing in UK law (my jurisdiction) for the purposes of review and quotation,
and fair use in US law (the rights holders jurisdiction) for the purposes of
commentary.
